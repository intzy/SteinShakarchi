# Solutions to the Princeton Lectures in Analysis.

The Princeton Lectures in Analysis is a series of four textbooks
covering different areas of mathematical analysis.
They are written Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi,
and written for the advanced undergraduate or beginner graduate student.
The following are the textbooks that are a part of this series.
| Book Number | Book Title |
--- | --- 
| 1 | [Fourier Analysis: An Introduction](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691113845/fourier-analysis)
| 2 | [Complex Analysis](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691113852/complex-analysis)
| 3 | [Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691113869/real-analysis)
| 4 | [Function Analysis: Introduction to Further Topics in Analysis](https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9781400840557/functional-analysis)

The purpose of this repository is to give solutions to select exercises and problems in the
textbook series to aid students who are learning the material by self-studying these books.
The following are my solutions to some of the exercises and problems in
Stein's and Shakarchi's Princeton Lectures in Analysis.

Note: it is likely that some of my solutions are not fully correct or complete.
Use at your own risk.
Furthermore, this repository is not meant to be a fully comprehensive repository of solutions
to all exercise and problems in this book.
