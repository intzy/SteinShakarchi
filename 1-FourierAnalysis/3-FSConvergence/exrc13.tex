%%% Exercise 1.3.13
\begin{exrc}[13]
    Suppose that \(f\) is periodic and of class \(C^k\).
    Show that
    \begin{equation*}
        \hat{f}(n) = o(1 / |n|^k),
    \end{equation*}
    that is, \(|n|^k \hat{f}(n)\) goes to 0 as \(|n| \to \infty\).

\begin{soln}
    We already proved in exercise 1.2.10 that if \(f\) is of class \(C^k\), then
    \begin{equation*}
        |n|^k \hat{f}(n) = \frac{1}{2\pi i^k} \int_{0}^{2\pi} f^{(k)}(\theta) e^{-in\theta} \ud \theta.
    \end{equation*}
    By the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, the integral tends to zero as \(n \to \infty\).
    Therefore, if \(f\) is of class \(C^k\), then \(|n|^k \hat{f}(n) \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\),
    i.e., \(\hat{f}(n) = o(1 / |n|^k)\).

\end{soln}
